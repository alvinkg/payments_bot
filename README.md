# A Payments Bot for Telegram
A simple Telegram bot that can accept payments. This code can be used by anyone as a template if they wish to build a bot on telegram that sells a service. 

A more detailed explanation of this code and how to build a Payments bot on Telegram can be found here: https://medium.com/@tr_18329/build-a-telegram-bot-with-payments-and-a-database-from-a-z-8f54ee1e1ecf.

An example of a bot I built using this template is: https://www.t.me/charity_rewilding_bot.

## Notes on the bot
I am implementing this to better familiarize with a vanilla python telegram bot.  I believe this approach adds one level of abstraction by using the python telegram library.
while I have implemented a web app using React, I need to get familiar with the standard telegram bot coding, using python, nodeJS, and how to implement using Netlify / Digital Ocean, Digital Ocean / Firebase.
